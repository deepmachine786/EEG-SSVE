% Onlinify Version 2013.11.06
% Onlinify is an application based on BCI2000 and Fieldtrip
% It is made to make creating online BCI applications a piece of cake!
% This file expects two functions from the user (BCI creator):
% function resultString = processSignal(signal)
% function userSettings = onlinifyOptions()
% For more info please read Onlinify Help.txt
